  "GPH": {
    definition: "Gallons Per Hour - the volume of water a filter can process in one hour. Actual GPH is typically 30-50% lower than rated GPH once media is installed.",
    researchPrompt: "Research aquarium filter flow rates and turnover rates: how GPH ratings work, why actual flow differs from rated flow, and how to calculate proper filtration for different tank sizes"
  },
  "Turnover Rate": {
    definition: "How many times per hour the filter circulates the entire tank volume. Freshwater tanks typically need 4-6x turnover, while heavily stocked tanks need 6-8x.",
    researchPrompt: "Research aquarium turnover rates and water circulation: ideal turnover rates for different tank types, bioload considerations, and how flow rate affects water quality"
  },
  "Media Capacity": {
    definition: "The volume of filter media (in liters) a canister can hold. Larger capacity provides more surface area for beneficial bacteria colonization.",
    researchPrompt: "Research aquarium filter media types and biological filtration: how beneficial bacteria work, media capacity vs surface area, and optimal media configurations for canister filters"
  },
  "Biological Filtration": {
    definition: "The process where beneficial bacteria convert toxic ammonia to nitrite, then to less harmful nitrate. The primary function of aquarium filtration.",
    researchPrompt: "Research the nitrogen cycle in aquariums: how beneficial bacteria establish, the role of biological filtration media, and maintaining healthy bacterial colonies"
  },
  "Self-Priming": {
    definition: "A filter that automatically fills with water and purges air when plugged in, eliminating the need for manual siphoning or pumping.",
    researchPrompt: "Research canister filter priming methods: self-priming vs manual priming systems, how priming mechanisms work, and troubleshooting priming issues"
  },
  "Pre-filter": {
    definition: "A removable mechanical filtration stage that captures large debris before water enters the main canister, extending time between full cleanings.",
    researchPrompt: "Research aquarium pre-filtration systems: benefits of pre-filters, maintenance schedules, and how pre-filters improve overall filter efficiency"
  },
  "Decibel (dB)": {
    definition: "A unit measuring sound intensity. 40dB is library-quiet, 50dB is moderate conversation, 60dB is normal conversation. Every 10dB increase sounds twice as loud.",
    researchPrompt: "Research aquarium equipment noise levels: how to measure filter noise, acceptable noise ranges for different environments, and noise reduction techniques"
  },
  "Quick Disconnect": {
    definition: "Valves that shut off water flow and allow hoses to be disconnected without draining the canister, making maintenance cleaner and easier.",
    researchPrompt: "Research canister filter maintenance features: quick disconnect systems, shut-off valves, and best practices for filter cleaning and media replacement"
